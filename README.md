# c_chat

### Sagacious Samosas

Rohan Sen, Matthew Cheng

### Project Description:

c_chat is a messaging app that allows users to connect to and message other active users.

### Instructions:

The user runs ./client which opens the messaging app.

Once running, the user is prompted to enter a name.
They are then given a numbered list of other active users, and can enter the
number to connect to.

After they connect, it's self-explanatory on how to chat.

Type !exit to return to the user menu
