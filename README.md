### Project Description:

c_chat is a messaging app that allows users to connect to and message other active users. You are able to chat in a group with multiple other users, and you can switch between as many different groups as you feel.

### Instructions:

The user runs ./client which opens the messaging app as a window.

Once running, the user is prompted to enter a name.

The user is placed into a chatroom with other active members.

After they connect, it's self-explanatory on how to chat.

MVP:
Open the app and immediately chat with other users in one large forum.
