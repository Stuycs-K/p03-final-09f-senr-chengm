### Project Description:

c_chat is a messaging app that allows users to connect to and message other active users. You are able to chat in a group with multiple other users, and you can switch between as many different groups as you feel. All chats are stored to persistance, meaning that you can pick up where you left off after disconnecting and rejoining.

### Instructions:
Our project requires GTK4, so if your linux system does not have it installed you must run: sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev (requires admin)

The user runs ./client which opens the messaging app as a window.

Once running, the user is prompted to enter a name.

The user is placed into a chatroom with other active members.

After they connect, it's self-explanatory on how to chat.

On the server, you can enter ./server for 127.0.0.1 or ./server ADDR for a different address.

MVP:
Open the app and immediately chat with other users in one large forum.
